# findNearestRestaurant
This code is for the second project of COMP10001 Foundations of Computing 2017 Semester 1

## What's this
This code takes in a city in the form of a grid as an input. Each grid has 2 restaurants. From a certain point in the district, the program will then find the restaurants that are within a certain distance from the certain point in the city.

## How does it work
The code uses the circle equation to lessen the search, so that it just takes districts that might be part of the answer and then checking the restaurants.

## Infestation
Infestation is the extended version of the program, it returns a list of the restaurants that are within certain distance from a list of epicenters.
